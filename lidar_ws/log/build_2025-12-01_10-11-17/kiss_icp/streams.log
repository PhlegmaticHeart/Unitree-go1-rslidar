[0.349s]   The OLD behavior for policy CMP0135 will be removed from a future version
[0.350s]   of CMake.
[0.350s] 
[0.350s]   The cmake-policies(7) manual explains that the OLD behaviors of all
[0.350s]   policies are deprecated and that a policy should be set to OLD only under
[0.350s]   specific short-term circumstances.  Projects should be ported to the NEW
[0.351s]   behavior and not rely on setting a policy to OLD.
